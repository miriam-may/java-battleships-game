# Java Battleships Game

This is a console application written in Java where you can play a one-player version of "Battleships".
The positions of the ships are chosen randomly at the beginning of each game.
There is a visual representation of the board using ACSII art. It starts empty, and fills up as you enter coordinates, e.g. "a3".
A hit will redraw the board with the correct square showing a "!", a miss will do the same with a "x". 

I am having trouble with my ship coordinates. I know where the trouble lies - with me improperly imagining the 2D array - I just need to find exactly where I am making
the mistake! Other than that, it works. I also need to implement anti-cheating code, as currently you can win by just hitting the same part of a boat 17 times.
